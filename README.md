# pyPigLatin
Small python script to convert words to piglatin.
It has a function called wordToPig that receives the word to be converted and the ending you want to add to every word, as there are many piglatin versions out there.
The main program just asks for the ending and then you input a series of words until you are bored with it, entering "exit" to finish its execution.
